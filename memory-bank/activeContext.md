# BeatShowcase Pro - Active Context

## Current Focus
The project is currently transitioning from development to production, with the following immediate priorities:

1. **Deployment to Production**: Preparing the application for initial public release
2. **Showcase Generator Optimization**: Fixing video generation issues in the showcase creator
3. **Payment Integration**: Setting up subscription tiers and payment processing
4. **Landing Page Development**: Creating a compelling landing page to attract users

## Recent Changes
- Implemented basic showcase generator functionality
- Set up Firebase backend with authentication and data storage
- Created initial UI for beat library and showcase creator
- Encountered and troubleshooting issues with FFmpeg.wasm implementation 

## Active Decisions

### Video Generation Approach
After encountering issues with FFmpeg.wasm (insufficient frames being generated), we're considering these approaches:

1. **Current Approach**: Fix the FFmpeg.wasm implementation to generate sufficient frames
   - Pro: Client-side processing reduces server costs
   - Con: Complex implementation, browser compatibility issues

2. **Alternative Approach**: Use HTML5 Canvas + MediaRecorder API
   - Pro: Potentially more reliable across browsers
   - Con: May have quality limitations

**Current Decision**: Continue with FFmpeg.wasm approach but implement better debug logging to identify the specific issue with frame generation.

### Pricing Model Refinement
Finalizing the three-tier pricing strategy:
- Free Tier: 1 showcase/month (with watermark)
- Producer Tier ($19.99/month): 4 showcases/month
- Studio Tier ($39.99/month): Unlimited showcases

**Current Decision**: Implement this pricing model for launch and gather user feedback for potential adjustments.

### Multi-Channel Strategy
Developing features to support producers managing multiple YouTube channels:
- Channel selection in showcase creator
- Channel-specific templates and branding
- Analytics broken down by channel

**Current Decision**: Include basic multi-channel support in MVP but keep advanced features for post-launch updates.

## Next Steps

### Immediate (24-48 Hours)
1. Fix video generation issues in showcase creator
2. Finalize deployment process to production environment
3. Set up Stripe integration for subscription management
4. Create initial landing page with pricing information

### Short-term (1-2 Weeks)
1. Implement user onboarding flow
2. Add additional visualizer templates
3. Develop basic analytics dashboard
4. Create referral system

### Medium-term (1 Month)
1. Enhance YouTube integration with better metadata options
2. Add custom branding options for paid tiers
3. Implement batch processing for multiple showcases
4. Develop community features for producers

## Current Challenges

### Technical Challenges
1. **FFmpeg.wasm Integration**: Current implementation generating only 3 frames instead of needed thousands
2. **YouTube API Quotas**: Need to implement efficient usage to avoid hitting limits
3. **Client-side Processing Performance**: Ensuring smooth experience on lower-end devices

### Business Challenges
1. **User Acquisition**: Strategy for attracting initial users without marketing budget
2. **Feature Prioritization**: Balancing must-have vs. nice-to-have features for launch
3. **Pricing Validation**: Confirming market acceptance of pricing tiers

## Recent Insights
1. Multi-channel capability appears to be a stronger differentiator than initially thought
2. Type beat producers particularly struggle with consistency rather than just quality
3. The referral program could be a powerful growth driver in this community-oriented niche
